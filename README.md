#WordPress Domain Mapping System (DMS)#
=====================================

##Description##
-----------
**Domain Mapping System allows to map domains to WP Pages and/or custom post types.**

If you're running a website on WordPress and need to create a related **Microsite**, DMS can help you. Both websites will run from the same WordPress instance and can therefore be managed by the same login.

DMS will analyse HTTP requests and check if the domain is mapped to WordPress content. If so, DMS will load the corresponding content. Otherwise, it will not do anything and let WordPress do its magic.

If you'd like to create a Microsite, you could use a custom template for a page (or custom post type) and use DMS to make the user feel like using a stand-alone website.

###Why not use WordPress MultiSite Network?###

Because it says:
>If you plan on creating sites that are strongly interconnected, that share data, or share users, then a multisite network might not be the best solution.

If you do plan on creating sites that are strongly interconnected and share data - **please do you a multiste network**!
